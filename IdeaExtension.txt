Basic idea of project is to build a app to distribute recyclable material efficiently and optimise path of collection 
Idea 
Part 1 ::
1. SMart bin : IOT project
of the smart bin : functionality is to check level of garbage inside : send signal to cloud about its status  to cloud 

When the Collector comes takes the update from cloud , marks all the bins that are full and take up the least path indicated 
by the app as found by using some smart algorithm 

Part 2 ::
collected recyclable material distribution to various factories that need it.
web app for that : 
kind of material needed
