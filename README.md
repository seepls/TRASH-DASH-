# TRASH-DASH-
first original idea on making an app . 
The basic idea is to make an app for 
collecting waste efficiently . 
optimizing path of collection , by turning dustbins to smart dustbins . 
making a dustbin smart is it self a IOT (internet of things project ) .
then collecting info about if its level , by adding sensor .
then it sends to app, the app marks out the location of full dustbins on map and gives optimized path to follow for the driver to follow in that area 

also there is a second part , but lets see how this goes about .:) good luck to me :P
